# A sing-along for Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al.

As a means for learning the R package [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms),  I'll be using it to model various examples and solve various exercises in the book [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin.

The files in here are compiled from R notebooks to .md using knitr. The original R notebooks can be found in the /source/ directory.
